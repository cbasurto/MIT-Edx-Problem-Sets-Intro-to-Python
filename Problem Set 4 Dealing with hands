#A hand is the set of letters held by a player during the game. 
#The player is initially dealt a set of random letters. For example, 
#the player could start out with the following hand: a, q, l, m, u, i, l.
#In our program, a hand will be represented as a dictionary: the keys are 
#(lowercase) letters and the values are the number of times the particular
#letter is repeated in that hand. For example, the above hand would be
#represented as:

    Assumes that 'hand' has all the letters in word.
    In other words, this assumes that however many times
    a letter appears in 'word', 'hand' has at least as
    many of that letter in it. 

    Updates the hand: uses up the letters in the given word
    and returns the new hand, without those letters in it.

    Has no side effects: does not modify hand.
